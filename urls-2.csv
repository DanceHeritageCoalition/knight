Students often begin at a young age and grow up in the school. This gives them a special community, committed to them for the long-term, in which they gain skills not only in ballet and dance but  also develop values such as discipline, focus, respect, confidence, bravery, team-work, and poise. These are meaningful values that support the student for a lifetime. Berkeley City Ballet believes that learning to dance well can also be fun and that each student can gain immensely from this art form."

Home ,http://www.smithwymore.org/,"Number Zero is both a game and an experiment in real-time computer augmented performance. This semi-improvised dance is about a semi-intelligent computer system threatening to evolve itself into a space opera, aka: a television inspired sci-fi narrative about a defective computer system taking control over a band of humans. Set in a near future world that is only marginally different from our own, the dance continuously reconstructs itself anew, searching in vain for the perfect balance of human contentment and computer power. The participants (performers) find themselves trapped in a kind of limbo where the only hope is to win over the “heart"" of the machine by successfully completing the system’s bizarre set of games of mental, physical and spiritual endurance. The work is comical, bleak and completely unpredictable. All we know for sure is that no two performances will ever be alike."
