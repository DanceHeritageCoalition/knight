Berkeley City Ballet - Welcome,http://www.berkeleycityballet.org/,"Established in 1974 as a non-profit, Berkeley City Ballet remains a consistent and enduring part of the city of Berkeley.

For forty-one years Berkeley City Ballet has created a safe, caring environment for students of all ages and levels where they learn to dance and perform. Students often begin at a young age and grow up in the school. This gives them a special community, committed to them for the long-term, in which they gain skills not only in ballet and dance but  also develop values such as discipline, focus, respect, confidence, bravery, team-work, and poise. These are meaningful values that support the student for a lifetime. Berkeley City Ballet believes that learning to dance well can also be fun and that each student can gain immensely from this art form."
