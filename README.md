Phase I: building a test scraper to find and evaluate dance criticism on the web
Currently, the scraper finds the first 100 results from Google and uses MetaHarvest to scrape the description metadata from the links.  The resulting metadata is saved as a csv file.
Results can be refined by adjusting the Google search criteria to exclude things like LinkedIn results.  Future development will refine the scraper parameters.
