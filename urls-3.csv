CriticalDance | An Inclusive Site for Dancers and Dance Audiences,http://www.criticaldance.org/,"As David Bintley celebrates twenty years at the helm of Birmingham Royal Ballet, David Mead sees his latest work, The King Dances, a ballet of strong imagery inspired by and freely based on Le Ballet de la Nuit of 1653, in which King Louis XIV of France appeared as Apollo, the Sun God – and his blockbuster Carmina burana.

Misty Copeland’s Odette/Odile | CriticalDance,http://www.criticaldance.org/2015/06/28/misty-copelands-odetteodile/,"Aside from being the most well-known ballet even to people who know nothing of ballet, Swan Lake comes with baggage. This includes the details and location of the story, the characterization of the Swan Queen and her evil body double, the Black Swan, and the choreography that has developed over time as part and parcel of the Petipa/Ivanov 1895 revival, which is considered the Swan Lake template. While audiences have grown accustomed to changes of venue, the characterization of Odette and Odile and the execution of the choreography must be just so. Odette has to be a regal swan queen, but one with sadness and pathos dripping from every pore while at the same time, not pushing toward melodramatic and pathetic. Odile must be sensuous and convincing enough to seduce a stone. And like the Rose Adagio in The Sleeping Beauty, her 32 fouettés are a true test, and must be done completely and correctly or the performance is fatally flawed."
Polish National Ballet in Washington | CriticalDance,http://www.criticaldance.org/2015/06/27/polish-national-ballet-in-washington/,"The Polish National Ballet appeared at the Kennedy Center courtesy of the Laurel Fund for the performing arts. Many in the audience, it seemed, had Polish roots and were especially proud to welcome this dance company to Washington, DC. Although the full company boasts nearly ninety dancers, the touring ensemble was composed of just twenty-three."

Summer fun in ancient times: Birmingham Royal Ballet’s Sylvia | CriticalDance,http://www.criticaldance.org/2015/06/26/summer-fun-in-ancient-times-birmingham-royal-ballets-sylvia/,"Like most choreographers’ versions of the story of Sylvia, Bintley takes his cue from Aminta, the sixteenth century play by Torquanto Tasso. Unlike most, though, Bintley taps into the way Tasso infuses the story of the lovers with moments of pure in-your-face comedy, even outright farce. Shakespeare frequently did much the same."

Misty Copeland is a Juliet to really believe in | CriticalDance,http://www.criticaldance.org/2015/06/24/misty-copeland-is-a-juliet-to-really-believe-in/,The June 20th matinee of American Ballet Theatre’s Romeo and Juliet was standing room only because that afternoon’s Juliet was ABT soloist Misty Copeland. Some people had come a long way. The lady sitting next to me had travelled all the way from San Francisco to see Copeland perform in Romeo and Juliet and Swan Lake (she dances the dual role of Odette/Odile at the June 24th matinee).

A tale of three Juliets | CriticalDance,http://www.criticaldance.org/2015/06/23/a-tale-of-three-juliets/,"As I’ve probably made all too obvious over the years, I’m a softie. My weakest link is Romeo and Juliet, and I consider Sir Kenneth MacMillan’s version to be the gold standard. What makes his ballet extraordinary to me is the combination of passion with essential innocence and impulsiveness of the lead characters, both of which are embedded in the choreography. The ideal portrayal not only reflects these qualities, but also transcends the fourth wall and engenders a personal response. For example, Alessandra Ferri combined passion with innocence no matter her age, and brought me (and I daresay anyone with a beating heart) onto the stage with her when she danced the role – consequently, hers is my gold standard of Juliets. Portrayals that are more passionate than appropriate, or come across as mature beyond their years, or are too aggressive, kill it for me. On the other hand, seeing the passion grow within the bodies of the youthful Shakespearean characters makes it sublime. And then there’s the vast territory in between."
